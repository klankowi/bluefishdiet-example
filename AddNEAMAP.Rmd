Thoughts from the WG in January

Not just add NEAMAP but also let model estimate any q adjustments for Albatross/Bigelow years

While we are there consider mean (and variance?) of predator length as a catchabiliy covariate

Is there output that can translate into inshore/offshore availability for the aggregate univariate index? Center of gravity plot, partition index into quadrants?

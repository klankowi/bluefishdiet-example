## Initial Summaries from NEFSC Bottom Trawl Survey

For the 13 October 2021 Bluefish WG meeting, we pulled summary diet information from the [NEFSC Diet Data shiny app, Fish Trophic Ecology of the Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf, by Smith B.E. & Rowe S., dated 9/20/2021](https://fwdp.shinyapps.io/tm2020/). These data were pulled 7 October 2021 and were saved in the `datfromshiny` folder in this repository.

Thoughts from the WG in January

Not just add NEAMAP but also let model estimate any q adjustments for Albatross/Bigelow years



While we are there consider mean (and variance?) of predator length as a catchabiliy covariate

Is there output that can translate into inshore/offshore availability for the aggregate univariate index? Center of gravity plot, partition index into quadrants? Need to realign NE SE instead of N and E and track the SE axis (lower inshore, higher offshore) see https://github.com/James-Thorson-NOAA/VAST/wiki/Define-new-axes-for-range-edge-and-centroid

Use fit$ model output components for density and define portions of extrapolation grid as inshore and offshore, find density in each over time


Timeline:

*  Finalize index 30 April

*  Working paper finalized 1 October 

*  Review 14-18 November 2022

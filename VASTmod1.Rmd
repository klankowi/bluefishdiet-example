Having built an initial dataset of haul-specific mean bluefish prey weight per stomach for piscivores, now we'll try to get a forage biomass index using VAST.

The approach here is to use exactly what @ng_predator_2021 for herring, but combining all bluefish prey (defined [here](https://sgaichas.github.io/bluefishdiet/PreyAggs.html)) as sampled by all piscivore predators at each station.

In @ng_predator_2021, seasons were modeled separately, so we will start that way as well. They used 100 knots, estimated by k-means clustering of the data, to define the spatial dimensions of each seasonal model. They used a a Poisson-link delta model to estimate expected prey mass per predator stomach.  

Read in data, separate spring and fall, and define knots:
